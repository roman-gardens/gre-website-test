Province Description Roman intervention in Greek political affairs resulted in conflicts that led to the destruction of Corinth in 146 B.C. and the sacking of Athens in 86 B.C. It was not until 27 B.C., however, that Augustus formally organized the Roman province of Achaea. Achaea consisted of the cities and territories of the southern Greek mainland between the Peloponnese and Thessaly, as well as Epirus in the northwest and the Ionian and some of the Aegean islands. The provincial capital was Corinth. Under Nero in the mid-1st century A.D. Epirus became a separate province, and in the mid-2nd century Thessaly was detached and added to the province of Macedonia. Under Roman domination many cities such as Athens, Sparta, Patras, and Corinth grew in size and prominence, the latter two partly owing to their importance as ports. After an initial decline in the number of rural sites in the early Empire, by the late Roman period the countryside was densely settled with farms and villas, due to changing landholding patterns and Roman improvements in agricultural and irrigation technology. The main exports from Achaea were wine, particularly from the northern Peloponnese, as well as olive oil and honey, linen and woollen textiles and marbles.

On this hill, according to ancient sources, Octavian camped during the crucial days before the battle of 31 B.C. (Dio Cassius 51.1.3; Suetonius 18.2, 96.2; Plutarch, Antonius 65.3; Philip of Salonica, Anthologia Palatina 6.236). At the foot of the hill lies the suburb of the city where the ruins of the stadium and gymnasium, and other buildings related to the Actian games are preserved. Strabo, writing during the reign of Augustus, describes the topography and vegetation: “Nikopolis is populous, and its numbers are increasing daily, since it has not only a considerable territory and the adornment taken from the spoils of the battle, but it also has in its suburb the thoroughly equipped sacred precinct, one part of it being in a sacred grove that contains a gymnasium and a stadium for the celebration of the quadrennial games, the other part lying above the grove on the hill that is sacred to Apollo” (7.7.6. translation: Murray and Petsas 1989). It is not clear from the above passage if the sacred grove of the precinct was a natural one, which existed before the erection of the monuments, or if it was part of the building program of Augustus, the founder of the city. Most probably the grove was contemporary with the construction of the stadium and the gymnasium, which occupied a considerable land space. In any case, the extensive work for the construction of the stadium and the gymnasium would have affected the existing landscape. The entire complex of the monument (Fig. 1) plays the role of both a victory monument and an open-air sanctuary dedicated to Mars, Neptune, and Apollo. It is built on two terraces. On the first terrace, a massive retaining wall of opus caementum, dressed with opus quasi-reticulatum, supports the pressure of the entire construction of the complex. Above it is the façade of the platform (the second retaining wall), the end walls of which return at right-angles into the hillside. The façade, facing south, preserves cuttings to hold the bronze rams (rostra) of the defeated fleet, while on its upper part were a number of large rectangular limestone blocks bearing a long dedicatory inscription in Latin to Mars and Neptune. On the top of this wall was a second, much broader terrace, along three sides of which stood a π-shaped portico, open to the south. The north wing of this portico marks the northern limit of the terrace, while its side wings run south up to the rear of the second retaining wall. The wings, which supported covered colonnades, created an inner courtyard 38x38 m. The area inside the courtyard framed by the porticos contained a monumental altar, probably dedicated to Apollo, and three pedestals, probably for over-life sized statues. Dio (51.1.3) mentions that the monument also constituted an εδος, an abode or throne of the god Apollo. The altar, preserved only to the foundation level, was decorated with elaborate marble reliefs in a Classicizing style that referred directly or metaphorically to the battle and the events that followed. The main scene of the friezes decorating the altar depicts the triumph of Augustus at Actium on August 29, 31 B.C. During the excavation of the upper terrace within the peristyle courtyard fragments of at least eighteen complete or partially restored ceramic planting pots were found (Fig. 11.1c). The average height of the pots is 14 cm., and all of them have a wide hole (2.5 to 5 cm.) in the bottom, made before firing. The size of these holes, larger than would have been needed for drainage, indicates that they were for the branches of a bush or shrub to be drawn through for air layering (for this method of propagating new plants see chapter 14). These wheel-made pots are either of ovoid or piriform shape with flaring rims; they always have, on the interior and sometimes on the exterior surface, grooves from the fingers of the potters. The clay of the pots is fine, powdery, not hard fired, ranging in color from pale brown to pale yellow, and the surfaces of the pots were covered in a yellowish brown to gray slip. The survival of the pots is a result of their placement inside the natural soil of the hill, which consisted of either gravel or yellowish clay. Much of the surface soil of the courtyard was washed away. The landscape design of the site is contemporary with the building of the monument. The pots were placed along the outer stylobates of the porticos at a distance of between 20 to 60 cm., from the stylobate. The planting of the courtyard towards the south, as it is evident from two planting pots, reached the rear of the podium. Perhaps other plants were placed near the pedestals and the altar of the monument, but for the moment this cannot be proven. The exact distance between the pots is impossible to calculate, but from the few instances where this was possible, we can conclude that the plants were placed very close to each other in front of the columns. The placement of the pots close together and near the stylobates would exclude the planting of large trees, which would cause damage to the porticos and cut off the view from the interior. No traces of the roots or the seeds of the plants that might have been in the pots have been found, but the plants used to decorate the most sacred area of the monument may have been laurels. The sacred laurel of Apollo is mentioned frequently in Greek and Latin literature. Besides its association with Apollo, in Roman life the laurel is connected with victory, victorious generals, and their triumphs. Octavian, on the occasion of his Actian triumph depicted on the marble frieze of the altar of the monument, stands on the currus triumphalis holding a laurel branch in his extended right hand and wearing a laurel wreath on his head. All the magistrates who accompany him in the triumph also wear laurel wreaths. The Roman Senate voted in 27 B.C. that a laurel tree should be placed on each side of the door of the House of Augustus on the Palatine, and a civic crown of oak leaves should be placed above the door. This was considered such an extraordinary honor that Augustus mentions it in his Res Gestae (34), and the laurel became his permanent emblem. Certainly, the plant of Apollo could not be absent from his Sacred Hill where Octavian erected the monument as an act of pietas to his patron god and to his divine supporters, Mars and Neptune.
